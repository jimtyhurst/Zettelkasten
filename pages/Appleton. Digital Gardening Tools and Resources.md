- What is "digital gardening"?
	- A garden is something inbetween a personal blog and a wiki.
	- It's a collection of evolving notes, essays, and ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date.
	- They're inherently exploratory â€“ posts are linked through contextual associations.
	- They aren't refined or complete - posts can be published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time.
	- They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal "blogs" we're used to encountering on the web.
