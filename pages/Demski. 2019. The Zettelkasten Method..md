- types of notes
	- jots: small pointers to ideas which you can write down while walking, waiting for the bus, etc.
	- glosses: a paragraph explaining the point of a jot.
	- development: exploring an idea in-depth. This writing is often still comprehensible years later.
	- refinement: writing which is publishable.
- essential features of Zettelkasten
	- _hierarchy + cross-links_: you want both a hierarchical organization which makes it easy to get an overview and find things, and also a “cross-reference” type capability which allows related content to be linked
	- _atomicity_: each page is a single idea.
