- taxonomy of notes
	- _fleeting notes_: temporary, to be processed within a few days before they lose their meaning. Once you’ve acted on a fleeting note, you can discard it.
	- _literature notes_: notes you take while you’re reading, engaged with other types of media (films, television shows, videos, music, podcasts, audiobooks). Capture your thoughts, your point of view on the content you’re engaged with.
	- _permanent notes_: fully developed expressions of your ideas.
- The notebox is a thinking tool: It only includes ideas you’ve expressed in your own words.
	- I do not see the advantage of this principle. I definitely want to keep my research notes analyzing other people's content.
